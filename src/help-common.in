  List R versions available to install.

  By default some releases are omitted from the output:
  - Versions older than R 3.0.0 are omitted. The installation of these
    might not work at all.
  - Only the latest release is shown for each minor version. E.g.
    R 4.2.3 is listed, but other R 4.2.x versions are not.
  Use `--all` to list all versions.

  Use `--json` to return the output in JSON. JSON output includes the
  full time stamp (if available) and the download URL as well.";

  Manage package libraries [alias: lib] (experimental)

  rig supports multiple user package libraries. The usual user library is
  called \"main\".

  `rig library default` shows or sets the default library for the
   current R version.
  `rig library list` lists all libraries for the current R version.
  `rig library add` adds a new library for the current R version.
  `rig library rm` deletes a library, including all packages in it.
  It is not possible to delete the current default library, and it is not
  possible to delete the main library.

  User libraries are implemented at the user level, no administrator or
  root password is needed to add, set or delete them. If you delete an
  R installation, the user package libraries and their configurations are
  kept for all users on the system.

  `rig library` is currently experimental, and might change in future
  versions. Feedback is appreciated.";

# This package is loaded from a project's .Renviron, via
#
#     R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES=rvenv,datasets,utils,grDevices,graphics,stats,methods
#
# It is the "in-session activation" leg of a rig project: it makes the
# project's `.rvenv/lib` library work in R sessions that rig did not start,
# e.g. in RStudio, Positron or VS Code. We deliberately do not use a project
# `.Rprofile` for this, because that would shadow the user's own
# `~/.Rprofile` entirely.
#
# `.Renviron` sets `R_LIBS_USER` to `.rvenvlib`, this package's own library,
# which is the one R has to be able to load a package from at startup.
# Switching it to the project library is this file's job. The path in
# `.Renviron` is *relative*, because the file is committed to version control
# and has to work from any clone location, while `.onLoad()` receives an
# already-resolved absolute `libname` -- so this is also where the relative
# path becomes an absolute one. That matters for child processes (callr,
# parallel, `R CMD`, `Rscript` from a subdirectory): they inherit the
# environment variable, not our `.libPaths()` call, so a child started in a
# subdirectory would otherwise look for `<subdir>/.rvenvlib`.

  # project root reads the project .Renviron itself, which sets R_LIBS_USER
  # back to the relative `.rvenv/lib`, and a grandchild started from a
  # subdirectory would then look for the wrong directory. So the variables

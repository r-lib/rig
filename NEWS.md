# rig 0.8.0-beta

* rig now supports aarch64 Windows. It currently only supports installing
  aarch64 builds of R and Rtools on aarch64 Windows. The x86_64 build of
  rig also works on aarch64 Windows and installs aarch64 builds of R and
  Rtools. Installing and managing x86_64 builds of R on aarch64 Windows is
  not supported yet.

* rig now supports RHEL 10 and binary compatible distributions like
  AlmaLinux OS 10 and Rocky Linux 10.

* R installations by rig now do *not* set the default CRAN repositories in
  RStudio and Positron (#203).

# rig 0.7.1

* macOS packages now include completion files for elvish and fish shells
  (#221, @TymekDev).

* `rig available --list-distros` output now includes PPM support, whether
  the a distro is retired, the EOL and in the JSON format also the last
  R version for that distro.

* `rig add` is now better at detecting PPM support for new Linux
  distribution versions. In particular, new Linux distribution releases
  do not need a rig update to learn about PPM support. Relatedly,
  `rig system detect-platform` now does **not** report PPM support.
  Use `rig available --list-distros` to see which Linux distributions have
  PPM binaries.

* `rig run` now exits with the exit code of the R process (#261).

* Custom certificates via the `SSL_CERT_FILE` environment variable
  work again (#227).

* `rig library default` does not crash now (#240).

* rig now uses a better way to get the user's home directory, that works
  on systems without an `/etc/passwd` database (#228).

* Windows: rig supports Rtools45 now.

# rig 0.7.0

* Bash completions work well again (#202).

* `rig rstudio` has a new implementation that works much better.
  Now it always defaults to the R version in `renv.lock` for renv
  projects, and can open RStudio projects or directories.

* New `rig available --list-rtools-versions` option to list available
  Rtools versions.

* `rig run` now does not terminate the rig process on interrupts
  (CTRL+C, CTRL+BREAK on Windows, SIGINT on Unix) (#187).

* Windows: new `rig system rtools` subcommand to add, remove, list
  Rtools versions (#18).

* Windows: rig now supports Rtools44 on Windows.

* Windows: rig now defaults to Rtools42 for R 4.2.x on Windows.

* macOS: `rig rstudio <version>` works again on recent macOS versions (#208).

  with 0755 permissions (#200).

* Linux: `rig add --without-p3m` works again (#193).

* Linux: `RIG_PLATFORM` works again when `sudo` is needed (#191).

# rig 0.6.0

* rig now supports RPM based distros, in addition to Debian and Ubuntu (#28).
  The full list of supported distros, on x86_64 and aarch64:
  - Debian 10, 11, 12,
  - Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04, 22.04,
  - Fedora Linux 37, 38,
  - OpenSUSE 15.3, 15.4,
  - SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP3, SP4,
  - CentOS 7,
  - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, 8, 9,
  - AlmaLinux 8, 9,

  See also the new `rig available --list-distros`.

* New `rig available` command to list R versions available to install.
  `rig available --list-distros` lists the supported Linux distributions.

* New `rig run` to run R, an R script or an R project, using the selected
  R version (#161).

  RStudio terminal (#127).

* rig now works behind a proxy, on macOS and Linux, if the `https_proxy`
  environment variable is set (#166).

* `rig resolve` now has a `--platform` and a `--arch` arguments, to look up
  available R versions for any supported platform, instead of the current
  one.

* `rig ls --plain` lists only the R version names, this is useful in
  shell scripts (#128).

* `rig rstudio` now starts RStudio with the correct working directory
  and project (#139, #100).

* macOS: `rig add` now only changes the permission for the R version
  that it is installing (#109).

* Windows: `rig rstudio` now starts the correct R version, even with newer
  RStudio versions (#134).

* Windows: rig now works in PowerShell 7.

* Windows: the rig installer now does not create shortcut in the start
  menu (#160).

* Linux and macOS: rig now keeps the locales when switching to the root
  user, so e.g. the language does not change (#138).

* Linux: rig now works properly in Oh My Zsh (#125).

* Linux: rig now works around a missing `/usr/bin/sed` that happened
  on some distros (#119).

* Linux: new subcommand `rig system detect-platform` to print the detected
  Linux distribution and configuration.

* Linux: You can now set the `RIG_PLATFORM` environment variable to
  override the auto-detected Linux distriution. E.g.
  `RIG_PLATFORM=ubuntu-22.04` will force Ubuntu 22.04.

* Linux: rig now comes with a CA certificate bundle, so it works without
  system certificates. If you prefer not to use it, set the `SSL_CERT_FILE`
  environment variable to point to your preferred CA bundle (#176).

# rig 0.5.3

* rig can now install x86_64 R 4.3.0 and later on macOS.

* rig now does a better job when resolving R versions.

* rig now supports Rtools43 on Windows.

* rig now does not try to reinstall Rtools if the same version
  is already installed.

# rig 0.5.2

* rig now always runs non-interactively on Linux from a root shell (#117).

* rig now always uses `--vanilla` when running R (#120).

* rig now detects Deepin Linux as Debian (#111).

# rig 0.5.1

* rig now prints output from `apt`, etc. like regular logging output on Linux.

* rig now supports the alises `oldrel`, `release`, `next`, `devel` in
  `rig default`, `rig rm`, `rig rstudio`, etc. (#108).

# rig 0.5.0

* rig can now open renv projects in RStudio, with the correct R version.
  Pass the renv lock file to rig: `rig rstudio .../renv.lock` (#74).

* `rig list` now prints the result as a table, and it prints the R version
  number as well. `rig list --json` includes the version number, the path
  to the installation, and the path to the R binary.

* rig is now more robust when setting up the user library. In
  particular R will not fail to start in renv projects (#81, @krlmlr).

* On macOS and Linux `rig add` now creates the user library with the right
  permissions, if it does not exist and pak is installed (#84).

* `rig add` now correctly installs pak into the user library, instead of
  the system library, even if the user library did not exist before.

## Windows

* On Windows, `rig add ... --without-translations` installs R without
  message translations. This is useful if you prefer using R in
  English on a non-English system (#88).

* On Windows `rig add` does not add a Desktop icon now by default.
  If want an icon, use the new `--with-desktop-icon` switch (#89).

  registry accordingly, and removes the default from there as well (#86).

* New subcommand `rig system update-rtools40` updates MSYS2 packages
  of Rtools40 on Windows (#14).

## macOS

* On macOS `rig add` now does not fail if it is started from an x86_64
  shell, when adding an arm64 R version on M1 Macs (#79).

* On macOS, `rig rstudio <ver>` now errors if R `<ver>` is not orthogonal,
  and the menu bar app errors as well (#90).

# rig 0.4.1

* `rig rstudio <version>` and `rig rstudio <version> <project>` work properly
  again (#77).

* On Windows, `rig rstudio` now properly restores the default version after
  starting RStudio, if a non-default version was specified.

# rig 0.4.0

## NEW NAME

`rim` is now known as `rig`.

## New features

* Experimental multi-library support. See `rig library --help` for the
  details.

* On macOS rig now includes a menu bar app that show the default R version,
  lets you choose between R versions and libraries, and lets you start
  RStudio with a specific R version, and/or a recent RStudio project.
  Start the app with `open -a Rig`.

* New subcommand `rig system setup-user-lib` to update the R config to create
  the user package library when R starts up, if it does not exist. The old
  `rig system create-lib` subcommand is now an alias of this.

* Better messages. rig has a `-v` and `-vv` flag now, for extra debug and
  trace messages.

* On arm64 macOS, `rig add` installs arm64 R by default now.
  (This is also true for the x86_64 build of `rig`.

* On macOS `rig add` does not change the default R version any more (#2).

* rig now supports Linux distros based on Ubuntu Bionic 18.04, Focal 20.04
  and Jammy 22.04. They need to have a proper `UBUNTU_CODENAME` entry in
  `/etc/os-release` (#34).

* rig now sets up automated system requirements installation with pak on Linux
  distributions that support it: Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04 and 22.04 (on distros
  based on these), on both x86_64 and aarch64. (This currently needs
  passwordless `sudo` or a root account.)

* All OSes create an `Rscript` link now that runs the default R
  version (#20).

# rim 0.3.0

* New `rim rstudio` command to open a project in RStudio with the specified
  R version.

* `rim add` now performs additonal tasks, to give you an R installation that
  is ready to use:

  - It installs pak for the newly added R version, it is wasn't
    installed before. You can opt out of this with the `--without-pak` option.
    You can select the pak version to install with `--pak-version`.

  - Sets the default R version after installation to the newly
    installed version, if no default is set.

  - Sets the default CRAN mirror to the cloud mirror in the
    system profile, after installation (#11).

  - Sets up RStudio Package Manager (RSPM) as the default repository, if
    your system is supported. See
    https://packagemanager.rstudio.com for more about RSPM. The systems that
    are supported by both RSPM and rim are Windows, and Ubuntu Linux
    18.04, 20.04 and 22.04, all of them on x86_64 architectures only (#15).

* `rim add` now only caches downloaded files for a day.

* `rim system add-pak` now has a new option `--pak-version` to specify the
  pak version to install (stable, rc or devel). Its `--devel` option is
  now deprecated.

* `rim list` now marks the default R version (if any) with `(default)` (#38).

## Windows

* rim has a Chocolatey package now, so on Windows you can install it with
  `choco install rim` and upgrade it with `choco upgrade rim`.

* On Windows `rim default <version>` now sets the default R version in the
  Windows Registry as well, which changes the default for RStudio.
  (Make sure you set the R version in RStudio to the machine's default
  version in Tools -> Global Options -> Basic -> General -> R version.)

## macOS

* On macOS `rim system fix-permissions` now sets the permissions and group
  of the `Current` link. Also, `rim add` now calls `rim system fix-permissions`
  for all installed R versions, because the R installed changes the
  permissions of all of them.

# rim 0.2.3

* `rim system allow-debugger` and `rim system allow-core-dumps` now work on
  macOS Big Sur.

# rim 0.2.2

* rim now supports the next version of R:
  ```
  rim resolve next
  rim add next
  ```
  The next version of R is R-alpha, R-beta, R-rc or R-prerelease if there
  is an active R release process, and it is R-patched otherwise.

# rim 0.2.1
